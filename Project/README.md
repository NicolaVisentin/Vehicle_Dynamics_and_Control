# A Model Predictive Approach for High Level Vehicle Stability Control

Design of the high level controller of Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) system. 
An MPC regulator is implemented for this purpose, and its performance is compared with other
common controllers, namely a PD and an LQR. The testing is
performed using Simulink and Matlab, simulating a Sine with
Dwell maneuver and evaluating the tracking capabilities and the
control effort of the controllers.
