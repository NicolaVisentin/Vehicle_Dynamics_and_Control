# Path following

This assignment addresses lateral control of a vehicle for the tracking of a certain desired path. In
particular, an MPC is used to compute the steering input necessary for bringing to zero the error on the
lateral position of a car with respect to a reference. Simulink
and Matlab, along with ACADO optimization toolkit, are employed to run simulations using a 9 DOF
vehicle model with nonlinear tire dynamics.
